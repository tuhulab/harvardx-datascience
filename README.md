# harvardx-datascience
This is the repository for my Harvard X Data Science course. Data Science course is offered by HarvardX in the MOOC platform edX. This serial Date Science course consists of 9 modules and will lead to a professional certificate in data science.

I use this repository to deposit my R codes generated in the exercise in order to:
1. version control
2. notes-taking
3. share with potential employers
