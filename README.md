# harvardx-datascience
This is the repository for my Harvard X Data Science course. This Date Science serial is offered by HarvardX in the MOOC platform edX. The serial consists of 9 modules and will lead to a 'Professional Certificate in Data Science' when all modules are passed.
More details about this course serial could be accessed from https://courses.edx.org/dashboard/programs/3c32e3e0-b6fe-4ee4-bd4f-210c6339e074/.

I use this repository to deposit my R codes generated in the exercise in order to:
1. version control
2. notes-taking
3. share with friends and potential employers
