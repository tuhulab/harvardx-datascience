## Case study of heights
Predict the gender from body heights.

library(caret)
library(dslabs)
data("heights")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
